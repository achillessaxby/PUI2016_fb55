# HOMEWORK 11

THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR GETTING AND CRUNCHING DATA! DON'T START ON THE LAST DAY!
### Assignment 1: 

Follow notebook instructions. Be careful! the geopandas dataframe for census tracks is VERY large. If you try and plot it all you are likely to crush your computer. Work only with what you need.

### Assignment 2:

Follow notebook instructions. There are many buisiness datasets that need to be downloaded and that takes time. Clustering often takes time, particularly hierarchical clustering. Dont start at the last minute!

Note that the link to the zipcodes geofile is broken right now. The file was uploaded in the repository because of that.
